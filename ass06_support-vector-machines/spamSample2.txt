Dear Friend,

I am writing to you with a new business idea I have been developing
over the past few years. After much planning and research, the time
has finally come to bring it to market.

I am looking for an investment from you, for I have some fund that I
will like to start a business with you. I think this amount would
allow us to start on the right foot.

If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to contact me at
( jerrysmith400@gmail.com )

All the best,

Jerry Smith
