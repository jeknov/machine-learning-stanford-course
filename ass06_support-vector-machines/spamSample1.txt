We've noticed that there is a growing interest in Oxford in agent-based
modelling, so we thought it is time to have another informal gathering to:

∑  see whoís working on what sorts of problems
∑  find out what software and packages are being used
∑  see who has what expertise
∑  create some new collaborations
∑  assist those who are new to the technique
∑  reinvigorate the network of existing informal contacts

Everyone will be welcome whether you're an undergraduate, postgraduate,
research fellow, or academic staff. It doesn't matter which department you
are in, what topics you're interested in, or what level of knowledge or
experience you have.

We are offering 5-minute presentation slots to anyone who wants to discuss
thoughts on ABM ñ particularly problems that might be well-suited for ABM or
work-in-progress. Please send email to kenneth.kahn@it.ox.ac.uk

Date:            Wednesday, 16 October
Time:            2:00pm ñ 4:00pm (though in previous meetings some stayed
past 5pm)
Venue:          Future of Humanity Institute, Suite 1, Littlegate House (1st
floor, on the left)
                    16/17 St Ebbe's Street, Oxford, OX1 1PT
